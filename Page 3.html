<p>In Bayern Munchen I found one of my new favorite stores. It was part soccer store and part Nike store. This store was three floors! My favorite sport is soccer and so this was amazing for me! In this store I bought a jersey from my favorite team and then I bought a new pair of shoes for 180euros. This was very fun for me. </p>
