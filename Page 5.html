<H2>Host Family</H2>
<hr>
 
<p>On this trip I stayed with a host family for two weeks of this trip in  Viersen, Germany. My family was unique compared to my other friends in this tour group because my family was not actually German. My host family was Turkish. This was more interesting in a way I was all ready for the German lifestyle but getting in this new scenario was good since I was the only trip able to do that. The Turkish family was more difficult because they didn't speak the same way of German as I did. They spoke with a Turkish slang which was actually fun because I learned another way to speak German so my friends wouldn't know what I was saying bu tour exchange partners did.  </p>
