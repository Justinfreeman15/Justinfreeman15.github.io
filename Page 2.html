<p>In Austria my whole group stayed in a very nice Hostel. There was four floors and we were about a ten minute walk from the Old Town. The Old Town was full of small little shops and it was just a one way street that would take about twenty minutes to walk from one side to the other. One thing that I found different about Europe compared to America is that in there McDonald's, they would sell beer to customers. Also somethings on the menu were similar but they all had different names. My highlight in Salzburg was when we to a gondola lift up to the Alps and were able to climb to the top of the mountain. There was even a spot that we penguin slid down but it was dangerous because there was a turn and if you couldn't turn and went passed the ropes than you would fall off the side of the mountain. But overall it was beautiful. </p>
